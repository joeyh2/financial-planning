# Financial Planning

## This project allows credit union members to assess their savings health and forecast retirement leveraging two tools

1. Personal finance planner -  allows users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund. An ideal emergency fund should be equal to three times monthly income. Monthly income is set equal to $12,000 for this particular analysis.

2. Retirement planning tool - uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. Monte Carlo data used to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount. $20,000 is used in this analysis.
